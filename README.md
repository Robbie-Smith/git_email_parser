### Git Email Parser
The is a ruby script that will find all the contributors to a git repository. And display the persons name and email address
sorted alphabetically. It will then delete the cloned repo after you run the script.

To get started:

In your terminal

* ` git clone https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/git_email_parser.git`
* ` cd git_email_parser`
* ` ruby script.rb username/repo ` (without the .git on the end)
* example : `ruby script.rb Robbie-Smith/kickstarter_clone`
